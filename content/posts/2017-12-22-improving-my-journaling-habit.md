Journaling - writing to clear my thoughts, feel grateful about the good things,Â  understand better the things I fear, and just to collect important memories - is one of my most helpful habits.

Others have written extensively about the benefits of journaling:

- Why Keeping a Daily Journal Could Change Your Life
- Become a Better Person by Keeping a Journal
- How Tim Ferriss Specifically Uses His Journal To Achieve Huge Goals

I have journal entries in different places and formats dating back to 2009, and I'm always amazed at how it improves my thinking and makes me feel better. However, I always face two problems:

1. I keep forgetting to write on my journal, even though I **always** feel better after doing so.
2. I often have a hard time knowing where to start writing.

In order to solve these problems (_and also have some fun with coding!_) I developed a TelegramÂ ðŸ¤– chatbot called Dear Diary that **a)** reminds me daily and **b)** has helpful writing prompts to make it easier for me to start writing.

It has been helping me (and a couple of other early users) to keep the habit going, and it's really fun to use! If you're interested, click here to learn more and chat with the bot!
