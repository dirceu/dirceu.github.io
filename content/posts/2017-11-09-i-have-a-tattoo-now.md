I have considered for a long time having a tattoo in one of my arms with a reminder: I wanted something that would bring me back to the present. I spend a lot of time thinking about the past, worrying about the future, or just daydreaming... and the more I learn about life, the more certain I am that being present is key.

With that in mind, today I went to the Black Ink Tattoo studio and got this:

I'm really happy with the result. Let's see if it helps!
