It's being increasingly hard to keep up with my daily creative output habit. When I started this I was on vacation and had 6-12 extra hours **per day** to do anything I wanted; I could do all those activities in a much more relaxed rhythm and concentrate more on _doing_ and less on being _efficient_ at it.

Now, when I finish work I'm usually drained and don't want to do much else... at least until I start doing it.

Inertia is a powerful thing. I can procrastinate all day long on opening LMMS and starting to play around, but when I actually do it, it's very easy to lose track of time and enter a state of flow.

Around 6 years ago I took on the habit of journaling (which is a fantastic tool to refine thinking, and very useful to revisit when evaluating life decisions, but I can talk about that in some other post); I tried many different things to make it work until I reached the final solution: every night before going to bed, I'd put my personal laptop on the kitchen table, with wi-fi turned off and everything closed except Emacs (which I used to write at the time). When I woke up, the first thing I'd do is open the lid and start writing.

That worked really well, so I'm going to test the same strategy for my current / soon-to-be habits. Every day I'll put my personal laptop on the kitchen table with wi-fi turned off and the required apps already open and set up on new documents / projects. I'll see how that goes and post the results here in a few weeks!
