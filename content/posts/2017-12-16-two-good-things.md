I've been going through some rough patches in my life recently, so I've been trying out many different things to improve my mood and change how I tackle my days.

A recent favorite has been the "two good things" exercise. It's very simple: every night my girlfriend and I talk about two good things that happened during the day, and why they were good things. As is the case of many worthwhile practices, this is hard to remember but yields very good results overall.

It's very easy to focus on what's bad or needs to improve (at least for me) so this helps me stay aware of the positive things that happen on a daily basis, no matter how small they might look like at first.

PS: I took this from a book or blog somewhere, but I don't remember and can't find where. ðŸ˜¶
