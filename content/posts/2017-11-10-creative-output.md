Recently I started making a conscious effort to create something new every day. Every day, I:

- Write and publish a blog post
- Take a new picture and post to Instagram
- Write and publish something on Twitter
- Write on my private journal
- Create a track and post to SoundCloud
- Work on different coding projects

I started these on different days and I'm not keeping track of it in any way (to-do lists, calendar streaks, etc), since I don't want to add any unnecessary pressure; I want this to be _fun_ and interesting, not a chore.

It has been an amazing experience: I'm proud of myself for creating more content, I'm getting some feedback, I'm building a foundation with this content, and I'm practicing **letting go of perfectionism** and just hitting publish.

Everything I've been putting out there is unpolished at best and just plain awful in some cases, but I don't care:Â the important thing for me is training myself on letting go of perfectionism and **publishing anyway**.
