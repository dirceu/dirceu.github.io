Quick report: this week I've finished the 'reloading' task - now with automated tests, thanks to the help of <a title="gocept.com" href="http://gocept.com">Christian</a>, my mentor. Now I need to document my <a title="gocept.zeoraid branches" href="http://svn.zope.org/gocept.zeoraid/branches/">branches</a> and write a post about what I've done on the coding period. I need to do this on this weekend, because next monday is 'pencils down' date, when all mentors must submit a final evaluation of the work done by their students.
