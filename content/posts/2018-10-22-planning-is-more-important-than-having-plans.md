I enjoy planning, but I think plans are mostly useless.

_Wait, what?_

We canâ€™t predict the future, and even mild predictions can be wildly wrong if you think too far ahead. The world is changing fast, and one of the best ways to deal with uncertainty is to exchange plans for options and adaptability. So, in my opinion, plans are mostly useless in the face of our dynamic, exciting world.

Planning, however, is an extremely valuable tool. It helps you think things through, consider alternatives, considers obstacles, define the lower level tasks that need to get done, and in general formalize a fuzzy idea into something more concrete.

Planning is a tool for thinking and learning, not predicting and controlling.

Do the planning but discard the plans. Learn what you can and move on, adjusting and course-correcting with the feedback you get from actually doing.
