As most of you already know, my <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/zope/appinfo.html?csaid=480505ACAC256B7D">student application</a> was accepted for the <span class="link-external"><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code</a></span> project. I will be working on <span class="link-external"><a href="http://svn.zope.org/gocept.zeoraid">gocept.zeoraid</a></span>, package that provides a proxy storage that works like a <span class="link-external"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID</a></span> controller by creating a redundant array of <span class="link-external"><a href="http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/FrontPage">ZEO</a></span> servers. ZEORaid was created by <span class="link-https"><a href="https://launchpad.net/~ct-gocept">Christian Theune</a></span> from <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.gocept.com/">gocept</a></span>, who is my mentor for this project.

I'm using the time left until the coding starts to learn how to use ZEORaid and how it's code works. I'm very happy and excited with this project, and I'm already learning a lot with it.

Many thanks to everyone who helped me, and good luck for all fellow GSoC students!
