It's hot and humid here in ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· - hot and humid enough for me to have trouble sleeping during the day, and get a jolt of energy when it's colder (night and really early mornings).

There's always a good side though: I've seen more sunrises in the past two weeks than I did in the entire year before that!
