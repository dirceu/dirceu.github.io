When we want to achieve something, it's easy to get so focused on the end goal that sometimes we get paralyzed.

"I want to lose 30 kg and exercise 3 times per week!"

Well, that's great! What are you doing about it?

"Oh, uhhh... next week I'll sign up for a gym."

And then life happens, and we forget. Or we remember, but we leave it for later because we still have to find a good gym anyway, or maybe because next week there's that work trip we have to take... In the end, we make no progress and get demoralized again.

Here's an alternative. Instead of focusing on the end goal and finding a perfect solution, ask yourself: what's the smallest step I can take **right now**? Not tomorrow, not next week: right now.

If you want to lose weight, maybe start by going through your house and throwing (or giving) away from all the junk food you have.

If you want to write a book, maybe start by writing 100 words right now, even if you don't know where to start.

What about you? What's the next step you can take right now to get closer to what you want?
