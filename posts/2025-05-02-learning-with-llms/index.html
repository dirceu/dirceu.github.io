<p>About a month ago I <a href="https://x.com/dirceu/status/1903238828082487642">quit my job as an engineering manager at Shopify</a> because I wanted to take some time to go deeper on LLMs. &ldquo;Going deeper on LLMs&rdquo; is hand-wavy on purpose: I wanted to explore a bunch of different things—developer experience, safety, interpretability, even the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning. At a meta level, I also wanted to use LLMs 10x more throughout my day to find out how I can use them more effectively and what are the friction points I could explore in prototypes or research.</p>
<p>Lately, I got into a nice groove of spending a few hours every single day (7 days a week) learning different things. This post is a snapshot of my current process.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use this full process for everything, but found it to be very useful when trying to learn something completely new or to go deeper into something I only know superficially. This is more about diving into areas like fine-tuning or neural network interpretability in a practical way such that I get <em>employably competent</em> at it.</p>
<h3 id="before-we-go-into-that-consuming-content-doesnt-work-for-learning">Before we go into that: &ldquo;consuming&rdquo; content doesn&rsquo;t work for learning</h3>
<p>This is the most important point about all this, more important than any individual tactic. Andy Matuschak&rsquo;s essay <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books">Why books don&rsquo;t work</a> explains this very well, and Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1756380066580455557">echoes the main point of it</a>: <strong>if &ldquo;learning&rdquo; feels effortless, you&rsquo;re <em>probably</em> not really learning</strong>.</p>
<p>We don’t <strong>really</strong> learn or understand something just by listening to a lecture, reading a book, or watching a video. <em>Real</em> learning, <em>real</em> understanding comes from actively engaging with the content.</p>
<p>We might <em>feel</em> like we got a good grasp on a concept, and we might be able to even recite a definition about it if someone asks, but this is (in most cases) a rather superficial “understanding” that breaks even with just a little bit of probing—a follow-up question or the need to use the concept in practice in a work-related task, for example.</p>
<p><em>(Sure, repeated exposure to topics might help you understand things over time and do pattern-matching, but what I&rsquo;m talking about here is building tacit knowledge—the kind of understanding you gain through experience, the stuff that&rsquo;s hard to write down but essential for practical application.)</em></p>
<p>How does one engage with content? Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using it in practice</li>
<li>Sketching something</li>
<li>Creating a flow diagram</li>
<li>Explaining to a 5 year-old</li>
<li>Writing about it</li>
<li>Talking about it</li>
<li>Doing active recall on it</li>
<li>Committing it to long-term memory using spaced repetition (e.g. flashcards on Anki)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-llms-can-help">How LLMs can help</h3>
<p>The naive way of using LLMs for learning is to ask, say, Claude to explain something to you or even to generate flashcards. That&rsquo;s still too passive and essentially effortless.</p>
<p>This is roughly the process I go through when I&rsquo;m trying to learn what can be broadly described as a skill (say, fine-tuning).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://superwhisper.com/">SuperWhisper</a>, <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>, and (occasionally) <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a> in this process. To read more about the AI tools I use, check out <a href="/posts/2025-04-24-my-ai-setup/">this post</a>.</p>
<h4 id="phase-1-exploring">Phase 1: Exploring</h4>
<p>First, I want to get a &ldquo;birds-eye view&rdquo; on the subject—let&rsquo;s stick to fine-tuning as an example.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect any links that I already have to papers, videos, blog posts, tweets, etc that might serve as context</li>
<li>Do a brain dump by talking for 3-5 minutes about my current understanding of what fine-tuning is and what it&rsquo;s used for, my practical experience with it, what I&rsquo;m trying to learn and why</li>
<li>At the end, say <em>&ldquo;summarize what I just told you, and then interview me: ask as many questions as you want in order to really get at what I&rsquo;m trying to learn or do, as I might not be clear on that myself&rdquo;</em> †</li>
<li>Answer most/all questions, then ask it to generate a prompt for Deep Research</li>
<li>Use Deep Research to get the lay of the land</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point I have a report that takes me 20-40 minutes to read, sometimes more. I use <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> to read those reports on an iPad, usually laying on the couch or in bed—I can&rsquo;t sit still long enough to read in my desk. I might also (or instead) paste it into NotebookLM and generate an audio overview to listen to while walking.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t follow most links it gives me: I&rsquo;m only trying to get a high-level picture and figure out what are the known unknowns.</p>
<h4 id="phase-2-refining">Phase 2: Refining</h4>
<p>Things might still be fuzzy in my head, so I do another brain dump by talking. I say something like: <em>&ldquo;OK I&rsquo;m gonna repeat back to you what I understood, and also try to mention all the things that are still unclear&rdquo;</em>. As I try to explain, the act of explaining surfaces what is unclear, and (usually) at least a few questions.</p>
<p>I get my answer and then do a bit of back-and-forth to clarify things. This might go for a while!</p>
<p>Every now and then I might do another brain dump or even restart the entire process if we went in a direction that doesn&rsquo;t seem particularly interesting or aligned with what I&rsquo;m looking for (and at this point, o3 already helped me refine much more precisely what I&rsquo;m looking for).</p>
<h4 id="phase-3-taking-action">Phase 3: Taking action</h4>
<p>This is the coolest part.</p>
<p>I start by asking o3 to generate me 10-30 &ldquo;micro-drills&rdquo;, practical exercises that take somewhere between 15 and 60 minutes. I go for volume because I can always pick a much smaller subset based on what&rsquo;s more interesting and/or unclear.</p>
<p>These micro-drills will typically show up as prompts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Micro fine‑tune embeddings (30 min)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create 20‑30 (question, positive doc, negative doc) triples (fast manual copy‑paste).</li>
<li>Fine‑tune <code>all‑MiniLM‑L6</code> for one epoch.</li>
<li>Re‑index and show improved <code>MMR@3</code> compared to baseline.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t understand the problem, I&rsquo;ll ask o3 follow-up questions. If I have most of what I need, I then jump to Cursor and will continue from there.</p>
<p>In Cursor I try to do many things ~manually but will rely on the Agent (typically using Gemini 2.5 Pro) to do anything that&rsquo;s boring and doesn&rsquo;t really bring me value (fix this dependency conflict, generate synthetic data for XYZ, etc).</p>
<p>After I get it done, I usually play around with the script: change some parameters, try variations to see what improves or degrades, etc. I also ask the Agent for two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give me feedback on the script based on what I&rsquo;m trying to do: this helps me learn what could be better</li>
<li>Create the shortest possible version of the same script, removing any nice-to-have&rsquo;s: this helps me learn what I could have done more efficiently <em>or</em> what are the most critical parts of the problem</li>
</ol>
<p>With this done, I try to come up with questions by myself. What are the implications of fine-tuning an embeddings model like <code>all-MiniLM-L6</code> vs fine-tuning something like <code>llama3.3</code>? What are the pros and cons? Can I script out variations of the same RAG application using fine-tuned versions of each? What could I do to make it overfit?</p>
<p>I then go to o3 and say <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it, here&rsquo;s my solution. Here are some questions I came up with afterwards. Don&rsquo;t answer those questions, just tell me: what am I missing? What other questions are more important or impactful to what I&rsquo;m trying to do or learn here? What are my unknown unknowns?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Then, I continue exploring with o3, Cursor, and sometimes even Googling (<em>gasp!</em>) things.</p>
<p>As I learn all this, I usually also write <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> flashcards to commit things to memory. I try not to overuse it, but I&rsquo;ve found it to be helpful: active recall, actually testing yourself is incredibly useful for learning and retention. See more <a href="https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-custom-instructions-and-prompt-snippets">Bonus: Custom Instructions and prompt snippets</h3>
<p>Some friends asked me to share prompts, but I do a <strong>ton</strong> of my LLM usage via voice in a very unstructured, verbose way: I yap until I get tired. Models are incredibly capable nowadays!</p>
<p>Still, there are sentences I find myself repeating in multiple occasions, as well as some sentences that I found helpful to add to my Custom Instructions.</p>
<h4 id="custom-instructions">Custom Instructions</h4>
<p>Be opinionated, push back, and ask questions that help me think about things in a different way.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about formalities.</p>
<p>When learning new concepts, I find analogies and concrete examples particularly helpful.</p>
<p>If I ask you to create Anki cards, make sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only use Basic (front/back) and Cloze deletion as formats.</li>
<li>Format the response to make it extra easy to copy-paste into Anki.</li>
<li>Break things down as much as possible. I&rsquo;d rather have 15 different cards for a single concept (if they&rsquo;re all atomic and exploring different facets of it, or different relationships between it and other things) than one gigantic card.</li>
<li>For Basic cards, always phrase the title as a question.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I prompt you with the single word &ldquo;GENSUM&rdquo;, this indicates that I want you to generate a summary of the conversation to this point as an artifact, which I will use in later conversations. I want you to include as much detail as possible that could be useful to reference later. The artifact title should be &ldquo;Chat GENSUM &lt;iso 8601 date&gt; [(<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)]&rdquo; &ndash; for example, &ldquo;Chat GENSUM 2020-01-01&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Chat GENSUM 2020-01-01 (1)&rdquo;. <em>(pretty sure I got this one from <a href="https://x.com/burkelibbey">Burke</a>)</em></p>
<h4 id="sentences-or-questions-i-use-often">Sentences or questions I use often</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is what I understood: tell me where I&rsquo;m wrong.</li>
<li>These are all the things I know I don&rsquo;t know. What else am I missing?</li>
<li>Summarize what I just told you, and then interview me: ask as many questions as you want in order to really get at what I&rsquo;m trying to learn / do.</li>
<li>Explain this in increasing levels of complexity (e.g. 12 years old, undergrad, PhD).</li>
<li>Help me visualize this with Canvas / with an Artifact.</li>
<li>What else should I be asking about this subject?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m still evolving this process—trying to make it more streamlined in a way, without removing the effortful parts that are useful for learning. Using AI has drastically accelerated the speed by which I learn new ideas, concepts, and skills; I feel more capable and most importantly: I&rsquo;m having <strong>a lot</strong> of fun.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts or ideas for how I can improve this, let me know!</p>
<p>† <em><a href="https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/">How to Read a Book</a> is an excellent tool for anyone that reads a lot for understanding (as opposed to for entertainment). One of the main lessons that stuck with me is that you should <strong>always</strong> read with a particular goal or problem in mind, which makes your actions more intentional, focused, and results-oriented. This is extremely useful in the world of LLMs.</em></p>
