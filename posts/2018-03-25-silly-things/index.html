  <section><p>In the past few months I took some time to evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>What I do or consume on a regular basis (books, music, games, tv shows, Twitter, etc)</li>
<li>What really brings me joy</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that has been sitting in the back of my head for a long time (not fully examined) is that the content I consume has the power to change my mood and even my interests for a certain period of time - which is one of the reasons why I make a point of reading my quotes and self-advice regularly.</p>
<p>When I started to compare what I do/consume on a regular basis and what brings me joy, I realized that there was a huge discrepancy. One clear example is that violent/dark content (games, movies, tv shows) - which is something I tend to consume a lot - makes me feel sad, anxious, and upset, at least slightly (which in some circumstances is all that it takes to create a bad day); playing some Doom or listening to some heavy metal bands (again, something I enjoyed doing every day) would make me more tense, anxious, and overwhelmed - even if I felt like doing it! Watching some particular episodes of Game of Thrones would make me feel physically sick, even if I was very curious about it.</p>
<p>After experimenting with that, I decided to try the opposite and only consumir <em>chill</em>, silly content&hellip; and it works! I started joking around, smiling more, humming to weird songs, and I found out really effective ways to improve my mood and make almost any day a &ldquo;good day&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Some things I&rsquo;ve removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t watch dark/violent/dramatic movies or TV shows. No more The Walking Dead or The Game of Thrones. 13 Reasons Why? Never.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t play games that make me feel anxious, tense, or overly excited. No more Doom (or most other FPS games), no more fast-paced violent games.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t read fiction books that makes me feel bad. American Psycho for instance&hellip; holy shit, <em>what the flying fuck</em> was the author thinking?</li>
</ul>
<p>What did I do instead? I started looking back and trying again things that made me feel happy and relaxed in the past&hellip; like watching anime, playing Animal Crossing, and listening to goofy happy songs. Some examples per category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Games: Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Terraria, and Phoenix Wright Trilogy. All silly, (largely) non-violent, and cute. ✨</li>
<li>Movies and TV shows: I scoured reddit and YouTube for &ldquo;chill anime&rdquo; recommendations and found some great ones! I recently finished &ldquo;Gekkan Shouko Nozaki-kun&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mushishi&rdquo;, and I plan to watch the original Dragon Ball again (before DBZ). I also started Little Witch Academia but I have some mixed feelings about it, not sure I&rsquo;ll continue.</li>
<li>For music, I&rsquo;m super into game soundtracks now. I&rsquo;ve been listening non-stop to the OSTs from Stardew Valley, VA-11 Hall-A, and The Crypt of the Necrodancer.</li>
<li>As for books, I&rsquo;ve removed from my Kindle every book that I &ldquo;should&rdquo; read for self-improvement and bought a bunch from my favorite genre: cozy mystery! I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle and I love it. I&rsquo;m also going through a bunch of comic books and mangas including Calvin &amp; Hobbes and Dr Slump, which are definitely some of my all-time favorites.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with most of the improvements I achieved recently, this is related to mindfulness and is far from perfect: I still catch myself feeling angry for no reason after doing a long sketch of work while listening to Children of Bodom. As someone said, unconsciously we don&rsquo;t want what&rsquo;s best for us, we want what&rsquo;s <em>familiar</em>, so I need a conscious effort until silly/chill replaces my current &ldquo;default setting&rdquo;.</p>
