  <section><p>Almost three years ago <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my boss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sent me an iBook G4 to work with. It was an absolutely awesome machine: fast, great battery life, beautiful hardware, beautiful OS. I loved it, but after 1,5 years using it some problems arise.</p>
<p>First, the battery just died - it just worked when connected to the charger. Second, I work(ed) with Zope and Plone on a daily basis, and things like running the entire <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gocept.zeoraid<!-- raw HTML omitted --> test suite took about 40 minutes. Even PloneTestCase with some functional tests was painfully slow. A Macbook was too expensive for me at that time, but I needed a new laptop.</p>
<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>
<p>Before using that iBook I used Linux for almost 4 years, so I brought an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inexpensive laptop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to run Linux. The laptop has an Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66GHz, 2 GB of RAM and 120 GB of disk space - a reasonably good machine, except for the video and the wireless card. It took me almost 6 hours to install Ubuntu on that laptop (which came with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Satux Linux<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installed by default) and much, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->much<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more time to get everything right.</p>
<p>I was reasonably happy with that setup, but every now and then I needed to fix something in the OS. One day I decided to buy a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->second monitor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and so I did it. Big mistake.</p>
<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>
<p>It seems that the SiS Mirage 3 video card is a Windows fanboy and I couldn&rsquo;t get the new monitor to work with Linux. It worked out of the box with an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Asus eeePC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> running eeeBuntu, but not on my laptop. Damn it. After that and some other minor annoyances I decided to give Windows Vista a try, following some advice from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sidnei<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Windows Vista surprised me. It&rsquo;s a good OS, every piece of hardware on my machine worked without &ldquo;serious&rdquo; configuration. As I can&rsquo;t live without a Unix I installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->andLinux<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it was not enough: using Linux to manipulate a NTFS filesystem is a PITA.</p>
<h4 id="mac-os-x---again">Mac OS X - Again</h4>
<p>After so much trouble I realized I was losing time with all these annoyances; then I saved money, did some freelance work on my spare time and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voila<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: last week I brought a white Macbook.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I&rsquo;m happy with it. It took me less than 1 hour to download and install every application that I need - well, almost all of them, since XCode is really big and the download took almost 2 hours itself.</p>
<p>One good surprise is XCode / iPhone Simulator. XCode is a very good IDE and it&rsquo;s been a lot of fun to learn Objective-C and how to develop iPhone applications.</p>
<p>If you need to buy some tool (be it hardware or software), buy the best tool your money can buy. Some programmers hesitate to spend some money on a good chair, on a good editor or on a good computer (like me, before all this) but damn, we spend 8-12 hours a day using these things! Every single thing that can save you time or give you more comfort is worth it.</p>
<p>I have a profile on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iUseThis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that shows the apps that I have on my Mac. If you have any recomendations please leave a comment!</p>
