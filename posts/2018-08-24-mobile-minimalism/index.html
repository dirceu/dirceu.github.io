I have a much healthier relationship with my phone now; in fact, I barely use it. This is what I changed:

I deleted my Instagram and Facebook accounts.
I uninstalled Twitter, Reddit, and Gmail.
I uninstalled Slack as well, but I install it on my on-call shifts (and remove it again afterwards).
I deleted every social media, game, or general time-sink from my phone.
I muted/silenced most people and groups on WhatsApp / Telegram / Messages, and I check those things once per day or so.
I set a Do Not Disturb schedule from 8 pm to 9 am. During that time, only my immediate family (wife, parents) and a couple of friends can reach me; other than that, I get no notifications.
I cleaned up my home screen to focus on what I want to reinforce.

<p>This is what my home screen looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1374.jpg" alt="phone"></p>
<p>I have no other apps. With this configuration, I help myself do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read (Kindle)</li>
<li>Listen to podcasts (Overcast)</li>
<li>Listen to music (Spotify)</li>
</ol>
<p>Why do all of this?</p>
<p>Because <strong>I</strong> want to be in control of my attention. The decision to engage with something or someone should come from me, not from anyone else.</p>
<p>Most apps are designed to make you use them more and more; in contrast, I designed my phone experience to be boring, silent and focused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimizing for non-engagement, and it feels great! I&rsquo;m more focused, I pay more attention to the people around me, I can focus on what I&rsquo;m reading or watching, and I&rsquo;m more mindful in general.</p>
<p>I highly recommend spending some time thinking about what relationship you want to have with your phone, and making changes to take more control of your attention and your life.</p>
