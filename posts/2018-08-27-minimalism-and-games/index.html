  <section><p>In the ongoing quest to simplify my life, I have been thinking about what other &ldquo;hidden to-do lists&rdquo; I have. I trimmed down books, apps, and even my goals and plans, but I still felt some &ldquo;open threads&rdquo; running in background in my head. Then I remembered games!</p>
<p>Ever since I broke up with Skyrim I bought more games and even went back to some of the older ones. That&rsquo;s fine: the point is not to avoid adding anything, but to constantly curate (more on that on a later post).</p>
<p>The problem is that I filled my Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch with games again: games that were there as constant reminders of things that I &ldquo;<em>should</em>&rdquo; play (after all, I spent all that money!) I decided to try a different approach: I deleted all games from both consoles (I only own digital titles), put them in their boxes and stored them in my closet.</p>
<p>The purpose of this experiment was to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I missed playing video games at all.</li>
<li>If I <em>did</em> miss it, which games I actually wanted to play (as opposed to games I felt like playing to avoid sunk costs or whatnot).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first few days I instinctively looked at the place where my Switch used to be every time I went to the living room, but told myself it was OK: I could just do something else. I replaced the time playing games with walks, fiction books, and writing, and felt great about it.</p>
<p>Even though all my games were digital, and I didn&rsquo;t kept tons of boxes or physical stuff, removing them and hiding the consoles made me feel <em>free</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been over a month, and although I do miss playing video games a little bit, I don&rsquo;t feel excited to play any particular game right now; I know that if I unbox the consoles, I will play something, so for now I&rsquo;m keeping them hidden from sight.</p>
<p>I have no idea how long this will last. I read somewhere that Diablo 3 will be released for Switch, so I&rsquo;ll probably buy that and play it, but until then I think I&rsquo;ll keep things this way.</p>
<p>Video games are not bad, and I&rsquo;m not doing this to be &ldquo;productive&rdquo; or to do &ldquo;better&rdquo; things with my time: the point here is to ensure that I&rsquo;m not doing things just out of habit. I want to do what I actually enjoy doing, and to achieve that yes, I might give up on a few things.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re happy playing those games, keep at it! If you think you <em>might</em> be going through a similar situation with dopamine-hungry habits, just try this experiment and store your console away; you might be surprised with the results.</p>
