  <section><p>I&rsquo;ve never been <em>really</em> happy with the city I&rsquo;ve lived in my whole life, Criciúma. It&rsquo;s a small city with not much to do, and although I have friends and family there, I always wanted to experience living in another city, meeting new people, and having new experiences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working from home for many years now, but it took me a long time to realize I was procrastinating on leaving town. Every year I would come up with an excuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I need to finish college&rdquo; (I did it four years ago)</li>
<li>&ldquo;My company needs me here&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s been closed for a year now)</li>
<li>&ldquo;My girlfriend needs to finish college&rdquo; (and she did it one year ago)</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and the biggest one: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I should live.&rdquo; Here is the thing: I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for the past 8 years, with a brief 10 months of working in an office in the middle of that. There is nothing stopping me from living anywhere I want here in Brazil or even in other countries that don&rsquo;t require a working visa. I wanted to leave Criciúma, but I didn&rsquo;t have any good reason to go to any particular city, and this lead me to analysis paralysis.</p>
<p>Morgana and I talked about it many times: &ldquo;We can live in Curitiba! It&rsquo;s a very clean city, with lots of theaters, culture and interesting people!&rdquo;; &ldquo;Oh, we can live a few months in Argentina!&rdquo;; &ldquo;I know! We can go to New Zealand!&rdquo;. Every time we would get excited, research the place and&hellip; nothing.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2014, after I started hanging out with some very smart people, and I realized something: I could just pick ANY city, move there, and adjust if needed. What was the worst-case scenario? I could lose a lot of money and I would have to go back to Criciúma and maybe live with my mother. The world would not end; I would not lose my job; I would not lose my friends&hellip; just money. Money that I could always get back by working extra hard and doing some freelancing on the side.</p>
<p>So in February, Morgana and I talked and decided to move to the beautiful Florianópolis. It&rsquo;s a much bigger city with great opportunities for fun and work for both of us; it&rsquo;s far enough from Criciúma to force us to make new friends and do new things, and yet it&rsquo;s close enough to visit our families at least once a month (including my father, who lives in São Paulo, because of lower plane ticket prices). It will make it easier to travel too, since Florianópolis has an international airport.</p>

<p>When I started really writing down my fears, the worst-case scenarios and how I could recover from them, it was ridiculously simple to make a decision: there was basically no downside, and the upside was enormous. I read about this concept of &ldquo;fear-setting&rdquo; before, but I&rsquo;ve never used it before to make a such an important life decision. I&rsquo;m now making a point to revisit it every week to see what else I&rsquo;m postponing because of uncertainty.</p>

<p>We finally moved here on June 17th. I&rsquo;m happy we finally took the plunge and moved, and I&rsquo;m really excited about the new possibilities!</p>
<p>Hello Floripa!</p>
